<h1><b>KavLachayim mobile app</h1></b>

KavLahcyim is a project I made for the organization for which I've done my national service.<br/>
This project was written in C# using the .NET framework (Specifically Xamarin.Forms) and is currently only working for Android.<br/>
The project is KavLachyim's website in native mobile app form.
